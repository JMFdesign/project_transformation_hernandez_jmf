## Comments

  * I apologize that this project does not meet with my normal standard of quality.  I had devoted today on my calendar specifically to this project but unforeseen circumstances derailed my plans.  My husband and I are in the process of trying to buy our first home and our realtor called with complications on the house that we are trying to make our home, and we had to act immediately.  We ended up spending half of the day trying to rewrite our contract with our realtor, a lawyer, and notes from the selling agent so that we don't let this one slip away from us.  I will continue to work on this and upload to GitHub after it has been graded in this form.
